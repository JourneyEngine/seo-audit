// columns to remove



// columns to add



// data questions

- can we add column 'secured' for url contains 'https'?
	- make flag column for mismatch between protocol (http / https) of url and canonical url / redirect url
	- are we locating a secured and an unsecured version of the page?

- agg_all
	- change flag_digit to be /number/ instead of just number

- columns to remove (review relevance + https_status effectiveness - all blank)
first_subfolder	first_subfolder_http_status	second_subfolder	second_subfolder_http_status	last_subfolder	last_subfolder_http_status

- schema_type 
	- add action to add schema if it doesn't have one

- potentially change GA date ranges to more than 1 month (for seasonality)

- add position data back in for semrush, leave it out for search console
